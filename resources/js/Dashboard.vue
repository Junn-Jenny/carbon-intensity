    <p>
        As the UK closes in on its legally-binding 2050 emissions reduction targets, it’ll be more important than ever to understand how green our electricity is and the impact of any action we, as GB’s Electricity System Operator, take to keep electricity flowing.

We’ve created a dashboard that shows, in real time, the carbon intensity of the system and our balancing actions as well as the current generation mix. It’s an exciting development, providing unprecedented transparency around and insight into our actions – and how close we’re getting to zero carbon operation.
